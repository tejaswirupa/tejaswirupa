👋 Hi, I’m @tejaswirupa. I am a data storyteller disguised as a scientist, currently based in Seattle, WA.

👀 Interests: I believe data is more than numbers! It’s patterns, people, and potential. My favorite thing is building models that don’t just predict, but explain. I love helping teams see the “aha!” moment in the data and turning it into action.

🌱 What I'm Learning: Most of my projects are born out of curiosity - “Why is this happening?”, “What changed?”, “How can we do better?” If I can break down something complex into a simple plan that sparks better decisions, that’s a win.

📊 Tools I use to bring ideas to life: ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=Pythonb&logoColor=green)

🧠 Currently geeking out over LLMs, time series insights, and building models that *talk back* (hello, chatbots 👋).
